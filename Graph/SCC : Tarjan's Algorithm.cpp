A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a directed path from any vertex to every other vertex.
A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph. 

Tarjan's Algorithm finds the strongly connected components of a DAG in O(V+E) time. This algorithm is DFS based.
Kosaraju's algorithm requires 2 DFS traversals and Tarjan's algorithm requires only 1 DFS traversal.

Algorithm :

1. DFS search produces a DFS tree/forest.
2. Strongly Connected Components form subtrees of the DFS tree.
3. If we can find the head of such subtrees, we can print/store all the nodes in that subtree (including head) and that will be one SCC.
4. There is no back edge from one SCC to another (There can be cross edges, but cross edges will not be used while processing the graph).

To find head of a SCC, we calculate disc and low array. 
The low[u] indicates earliest visited vertex (the vertex with minimum discovery time) that can be reached from subtree rooted with u. A node u is head if disc[u] = low[u].

Low value of a node u can change in two cases:

Case1 (Tree Edge): If node v is not visited already, then after DFS of v is complete, then minimum of low[u] and low[v] will be updated to low[u].
low[u] = min(low[u], low[v]);

Case 2 (Back Edge): When child v is already visited, then minimum of low[u] and Disc[v] will be updated to low[u].
low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v]);

To track the subtree rooted at head, we can use a stack (keep pushing node while visiting). When a head node found, pop all nodes from stack till you get head out of stack.

To make sure, we donâ€™t consider cross edges, when we reach a node which is already visited, we should process the visited node only if it is present in stack, else ignore the node.
